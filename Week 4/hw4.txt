CS 35L week 4

2. check out v3.0 into a new branch called quote:
   	 git checkout v3.0 -b "quote"

3. run the patch command:
       patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

5. compose a ChangeLog entry for the patch:
       I went into each of the 6 modified files (cmp.c, diff.c, diff3.c, dir.c,
       sdiff.c, and util.c) and used C-x 4 a to update the Changelog for them.

6. commit changes to the new branch
       git add .
       git commit --file=src/Changelog
   check that the commit worked:
       git log

7. generate a file formatted-patch.txt
       git format-patch -1 --stdout  > formatted-patch.txt

8. verify partner's patch:
       git checkout v3.0 -b partner
       git am formatted-patch.txt
   build the resulting system:
       ./bootstrap
       ./configure
       make
       make check

9. verify the ChangeLog entry works:
       make distdir
       cat diffutils-3.0.1-1c16/ChangeLog
   The ChangeLog contained my commit at the top!
