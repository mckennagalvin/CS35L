1. grab Coreutils 7.6:
   	wget ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gx

2. untar coreutils:
   	 tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
   create directory in which to install coreutils:
   	  cd coreutils-7.6
   	  mkdir coreutilsInstall
   	  cd coreutils-7.6
   read the man page for instructions on which prefix to use to configure:
   	  cat INSTALL
   	  ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/mckenna/Documents/CS35L/week3
   	  coreutilsInstall
   make and install:
   	  make
	  make install

3. reproduce the bug:
   	  cd /u/cs/ugrad/mckenna/Documents/CS35L/week3/coreutilsInstall/bin
	  ./ls -l
   it output date in the wrong format, as expected

4. apply Brady's patch:
   	  cd ~/Documents/CS35L/week3/coreutils-7.6
   	  emacs patch_file
   copied and pasted patch
   used man patch to find out that you need the option -p1 to get rid
   of the "a/" and "b/" from the source so the paths are correct
      	  patch =p1 < patch_file

5. build but don't install the fixed version:
   	  make
   All you need is the make instruction, because it takes the directions from
   the Makefile and only updates modified files. Only the ls.c file was
   modified, so we only needed to execute the make command to reflect those
   changes.

6. check the modified ls:
   	  cd src
   	  ./ls -l
   the modified ls fixed it!
   testing on a file that's old: touch -t 201101010111 oldfile
   testing on a recent file: touch -t 201410201111 newerfile
