<h1>Assignment 3. Installing and modifying software</h1>

<h2>Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package</h2>

<p>Keep a log in the file <code>lab3.txt</code> of what you do in the
lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should not
merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<p>You're helping to build an application containing a shell script
that invokes the <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/ls.html'><code>ls</code></a>
command to get file status.
Your application is running atop the Maroon Chapeau Enterprise Linux 5 distribution, which uses the <code>ls</code> implementation supplied by <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/'>Coreutils</a> 7.6.
You've been
running into the problem that for some users <code>ls</code> generates
output that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 729040 2009-03-02 06:22 /bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>The users want the traditional Unix format, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 729040 Mar  2  2009 /bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>You've been asked to look into the problem and fix it.</p>

<p>You discover that the problem is that in some cases users set their
locale to a value like <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>, for example, by
setting the <code>LC_ALL</code> environment variable to that value:

<pre><code>$ export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
</code></pre>

<p>Users who have done this get the YYYY-MM-DD date instead of the
traditional Unix date.</p>

<p>You nose around on the net, and discover that the problem is that
the locale files for Coreutils are not generated properly
(see <a href='http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-09/msg00398.html'>Jim
Meyering's message of 2009-09-29</a>,
also <a href='http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-coreutils@gnu.org/msg17915.html'>archived</a>
in case the primary web site is down). Getting these files generated
and distributed to all your clients seems like a bit of a hassle, so
instead, you decide to patch the <code>ls</code> program instead,
using <a href='http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-09/msg00410.html'>a
temporary workaround patch published by P&aacute;draig Brady</a>
(also <a href='http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-coreutils@gnu.org/msg17927.html'>archived</a>).</p>

<p>Try Brady's workaround, as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>Grab <a
href='ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz'>Coreutils 7.6</a>.</li>

<li>Compile and install your copy of
Coreutils into a temporary directory of your own. Note
any problems you run into.</li>

<li>Reproduce the bug on your machine with the unmodified version of coreutils.
You may need to use the <a href='http://man.he.net/man8/locale-gen'><code>locale-gen</code></a> program to generate
the <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> locale.</li>

<li>Use Emacs or Vim to apply
Brady's patch.</li>

<li>Type the command <code>make</code> at the top level of your source
tree, so that you build (but do not install) the fixed version. For each
command that gets executed, explain why it needed to be executed (or
say that it wasn't neeeded).</li>

<li>Make sure your change fixes the bug, by testing that the
modified <code>ls</code> works on your test case and that the
installed <code>ls</code> doesn't. Test on a file that has been
recently modified, and on a file that is at least a year old. You can
use
the <code><a href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/touch.html'>touch</a></code>
command to artficially mark a file as being a year old.</li>
</ol>

<p>Q1. Why did Brady's patch remove the line
"<code>case_long_iso_time_style:</code>"?  Was it necessary to remove
that line? Explain.</p>

<p>Q2. If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils
instead of the default one, what else should you watch out for? Might
this new version of Coreutils introduce other problems with your
application, perhaps in countries where users don't speak English and
don't understand English-format dates?</p>

<h2>Homework: Generating random lines from a file</h2>

<p>Consider the Python script
<a href='randline.py'><code>randline.py</code></a>.</p>

<p>Q3. What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like
<code>/dev/null</code>, and why?</p>

<p>Q4. What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather
than Python 2, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by
using the command <samp>python3</samp> instead
of <samp>python</samp>.)</p>

<p>Modify <code>randline.py</code> so that it takes an arbitrary
positive number of input file arguments, not just one. If an input file ends
in a non-newline character, your code should silently act as if a
newline were appended to the file. As with the
original <code>randline.py</code>, your program should report an error
if given no input file arguments.</p>

<p>Currently, if the input contains duplicate lines,
<code>randline.py</code> generates a copy of each line with probability
proportional to the number of duplicates. Modify <code>randline.py</code>
so that it also accepts a new option <code>-u</code> (long version
<code>--unique</code>); when this option is used, duplicate lines in
the input are ignored, so the input is treated as if it has no
duplicates, and the probability that a line is generated is
independent of the number of copies of that line in the
input. Duplicate lines should be detected even when they are not
adjacent in the input. Two lines are considered duplicates if they
contain the same bytes in the same order, not counting the trailing
newline.</p>

<p>Also, currently <code>randline.py</code> outputs lines with replacement;
for example, it's possible that it will output the first input line
two or more times. Modify <code>randline.py</code> so that it accepts
a new option <code>-w</code> (long
version <code>--without-replacement</code>) which causes it to output
lines without replacement: for example, the first input line is copied
to the output at most once. If the input contains duplicate lines and
the <code>-u</code> option is not used, the
output can contain the same duplicates, but no more duplicates than
what appeared in the input.
With the <code>-w</code> option it is an error if the
input file contains fewer than <code>NUMLINE</code> lines, just as
it is already an error without the new option to invoke
<code>randline.py</code> on an empty file and ask it for one or more
lines of output. You need not worry about the exact diagnostic you
generate for this new error, so long as you generate some diagnostic.</p>

<p>The <code>-u</code> and <code>-w</code> options can both be specified;
if so, duplicates are implicitly removed from the input before the
output lines are generated without replacement.  It is therefore an
error if the number of non-duplicate input lines is less than the
number of output lines requested.</p>

<p>Your modified version of <code>randline.py</code> should use only
the <samp>string</samp> module and the modules
that <code>randline.py</code> already uses (it should not import any
other modules). Don't forget to change its usage message to
accurately describe the modified behavior.</p>

<p>Port your modified <code>randline.py</code> to Python 3. Make sure that it
still works with Python 2. Don't rewrite it from scratch; make as few
changes as is reasonable.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit the following files.</p>

<ul>

<li>The file <code>lab3.txt</code> as described in the lab.</li>

<li>A file <code>hw3.txt</code> containing the answer to questions
Q1 through Q4 noted above.</li>

<li>The modified file <code>randline.py</code> as described
in the homework.</li>

</ul>

<p>All files should be ASCII text files, with no
carriage returns, and with no more than 80 columns per line. The shell
command:</p>

<pre><code>expand lab3.txt hw3.txt randline.py | awk '/\r/ || 80 &lt; length'
</code></pre>

<p>should output nothing.</p>
