<h2>Laboratory: Debugging a C program</h2>

<p>As usual, keep a log in the file <samp>lab5.txt</samp> of what you
do in the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<p>You're helping to maintain an old stable version
of <samp>coreutils</samp>,
but <a href='coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz'>that version</a> has a bug in
its implementation of the <samp>ls</samp> program.
(Actually, it has two bad bugs, but for now we'll just look
at the first one.)</p>

<p>The bug is that <samp>ls -t</samp> mishandles files whose time stamps are
very far in the past. It seems to act as if they are in the future.
For example:</p>

<pre><samp>$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
$ cd $tmp
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
$ touch now
$ sleep 1
$ touch now1
$ TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 2013-04-29 16:42:48.358233532 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 2013-04-29 16:42:47.355197103 +0000 now
$ cd
$ rm -fr $tmp
</samp></pre>

<p>Build this old version of coreutils as-is, and then again with <a href='coreutils.diff'>this renaming patch</a>. What problems did you have when building it as-is, and why did the renaming patch fix them?</p>

<p>Reproduce the problem. Use a debugger to figure out what went wrong and to fix the
corresponding source file.</p>

<p>Construct a new patch file <samp>lab5.diff</samp> containing your
coreutils fixes, in the form of a ChangeLog entry followed by a <samp>diff
-u</samp> patch.</p>

<p>Also, try to reproduce the problem in your home directory on the
SEASnet Linux servers, instead of using the <samp>$tmp</samp> directory.
When running the above test case, use the
already-installed <samp>touch</samp> and <samp>ls</samp> utilities
instead of the old version of coreutils. How well does SEASnet do?</p>

<h2>Homework: Sorting encrypted text</h2>

<p>The basic idea is that we want to sort encoded data without
decoding and encoding it. That is, our input is an encoded file, and
we could compute the output by decoding the input, sorting the decoded
data, and then encoding the resulting output&mdash;except that we
do not want to encode or decode anything.</p>

<p>Write a C function <samp>rot13cmp</samp> that takes two arguments
<samp>a</samp> and <samp>b</samp> as input and returns
an <samp>int</samp> result that is negative, zero, or positive
depending on whether <samp>a</samp> is less than, equal to, or greater
than <samp>b</samp>. Each argument is of type <samp>char const
*</samp>, and each points to an array of non-newline bytes that is
followed by a newline byte. Use standard byte-by-byte lexicographic
comparison on the non-newline bytes, in the style of
the <a href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/memcmp.html'><samp>memcmp</samp></a>
function, except that you should assume that both arrays are
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13'>ROT13</a>
encoded and should return the equivalent of
running <samp>memcmp</samp> on the corresponding unencoded
arrays. If one array is a prefix of the other, then
consider the shorter to be less than the longer. The newline bytes
are not considered to be part of either array, so they do not
participate in the comparison.</p>

<p>For example, <samp>rot13cmp ("\0Dhvpx23\n", "\0Whzcf!\n")</samp>
should return a positive <samp>int</samp>
because <samp>"\0Dhvpx23"</samp> is the ROT13 encoding
of <samp>"\0Quick23"</samp> and <samp>"\0Whzcf!"</samp> the ROT13
encoding of <samp>"\0Jumps!"</samp>, and <samp>"\0Quick23"</samp> is
greater than <samp>"\0Jumps!"</samp> in the ASCII collating sequence.
As the example demonstrates, null bytes <samp>'\0'</samp> are allowed
in the byte arrays and do contribute to the comparison.</p>

<p>Use your C function to write a program <samp>srot13</samp> that
reads from standard input in ROT13 format, and writes a sorted version
to standard output in the same format. Your program should do all the
sorting work itself, by calling <samp>rot13cmp</samp>. If standard
input ends in a partial record that does not have a trailing newline,
your program should behave as if a newline byte were appended to the
input.</p>

<p>Use <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdio.h.html'><samp>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</samp></a>
functions to do I/O. Use <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/malloc.html'><samp>malloc</samp></a>,
<a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/realloc.html'><samp>realloc</samp></a>
and <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/free.html'><samp>free</samp></a>
to allocate enough storage to hold all the input, and use <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/qsort.html'><samp>qsort</samp></a>
to sort the data. Do not assume that the input file is not growing:
some other process may be appending to it while you're reading, and
your program should continue to read until it reaches end of file. For
example, your program should work on the
file <samp>/proc/self/maps</samp>, a "file" that is constantly
mutating: it always appears to be of size 0 when you <samp>ls</samp>
it, but it always contains nonempty contents if you read it. You
should make sure your program works on empty files, as well as on
files that are relatively large, such
as <samp>/usr/local/cs/jdk*/jre/lib/rt.jar</samp> on SEASnet.</p>

<p>If the program encounters an error of any kind (including
input, output or memory allocation failures, it should report the error to
<samp>stderr</samp> and exit with status 1; otherwise, the program
should succeed and exit with status 0. The program need not report
<samp>stderr</samp> output errors.</p>

<p>For example, the shell command:</p>

<pre><samp><a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/printf.html'>printf</a> '\0Gur\n\0Dhvpx\n\0Oebja\n\0sbk\n\twhzcf\n\tbire\n\tgur\n\tynml\n\tqbt.' |
./srot13 |
<a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/od.html'>od</a> -c
</samp></pre>

<p>should output:</p>

<pre><samp>0000000  \0   O   e   b   j   a  \n  \0   D   h   v   p   x  \n  \0   G
0000020   u   r  \n  \0   s   b   k  \n  \t   q   b   t   .  \n  \t   w
0000040   h   z   c   f  \n  \t   y   n   m   l  \n  \t   b   i   r   e
0000060  \n  \t   g   u   r  \n
0000066
</samp></pre>

<p>because decoding <samp>srot13</samp>'s input (with a trailing
newline appended) yields:</p>

<pre><samp>^@The
^@Quick
^@Brown
^@fox
^Ijumps
^Iover
^Ithe
^Ilazy
^Idog.
</samp></pre>

<p>where <samp>^@</samp> denotes a null byte <samp>'\0'</samp>,
and <samp>^I</samp> denotes a tab byte <samp>'\t'</samp>.
Sorting this yields:<p>

<pre><samp>^@Brown
^@Quick
^@The
^@fox
^Idog.
^Ijumps
^Ilazy
^Iover
^Ithe
</samp></pre>

<p>and encoding this yields the output shown above.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit the following files.</p>

<ul>
