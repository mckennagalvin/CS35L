CS 35L week8

For the first part of the homework, I got access to an Amazon EC2 instance
and reproduced the web server crash that I did during the lab. These are the
steps I took to do so:

SETTING UP THE SERVER:
- created an account with AWS
- launched an instance of Amazon EC2 (selected Red Hat AMI, created key pair
  named 35L.pem)
  	instance ID is i-6eee4b62
	public DNS is ec2-54-148-111-29.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

SSH INTO SERVER:
- launched terminal window on my Mac
- cd Desktop
- chmod 400 35L.pem
- ssh -i 35L.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-148-111-29.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

TRANSFERRING THE STHTTPD FILES:
- launched new terminal window on my Mac, changed directory to Desktop where
  I had the key and the sthttpd-2.26.4 folder
- for simplicity's sake I manually applied the patch to thttpd.c when the file
  was just on my Mac before I transferred it over to the server using scp
  (since emacs wouldn't be installed on the server)
- scp -i 35L.pem -r sthttpd-2.26.4
  ec2-user@ec2-54-148-111-29.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~

COMPILING THE SOIURCE CODE:
- changed back to terminal that was ssh'ing to the server
- sudo yum install gcc
- cd sthtttpd-2.26.4
- ./configure CFLAGS="-g"
- make

I then followed the same steps that I did in the lab to crash the server.

The second part of the homework involves ranking the seriousness of each
vulnerability. From most urgent vulnerability to least:

1.

5. VU #213119: KDC fails to properly validate PAC signature
   I ranked this one lower because the person exploiting the vulnerability must
   first be a user on the domain, and the computers that they can exploit are
   limited to those on the domain.
