CS 35L week 6

For this lab, we split up into pairs and SSHed to each other, taking turns
at being the server administrator and the client.

***************************************************************************
  SETUP
***************************************************************************
We first used ifconfig to get each other's IP addresses. This would be
necessary later on when trying to connect to the other's server.

***************************************************************************
  AS THE SERVER
***************************************************************************
generate the public and private keys
    ssh-keygen

create an account for the partner (client):
    sudo useradd -d /home/michael -m michael
    sudo passwd michael
    (made the password ucla123)

create .ssh directory for the partner
    cd /home/michael
    sudo mkdir .ssh

changed ownership and permission on .ssh directory
    sudo chown -R michael .ssh
    sudo chmod 700 .ssh

my partner then ssh'ed onto my server

***************************************************************************
  AS THE CLIENT
***************************************************************************
after my partner created a username and password for me on his computer:

generate public and private keys
    ssh-keygen

copy public key to the server for key-based authentication
    ssh-copy-id -i mckenna@<partner's IP address>

add private key to authentication agent
    ssh-add
    (typed in password)

now SSH to server
    ssh mckenna@<partner's IP address>

tried out X-session forwarding
    ssh -X mckenna<partner's IP address>
    (tried running firefox and the GUI was shown in my window!)
