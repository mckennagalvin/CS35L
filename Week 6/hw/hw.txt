CS 35L week 6

1. If the other teams had been observing all the bytes going across the
   network, it would still be secure because the data would be already be
   encrypted and thus interpreted as gibberish. Without the private key, the
   hacker wouldn't be able to interpret the bytes.

   If the other teams had tapped our keyboard, the network would not be secure
   because they could be able to find out passwords and passcodes if we had
   to type them in.

   If I were booting off USB and the other team had physical possession of it,
   they would be able to access the private key and thus be able to decrypt
   messages, making the network not secure.

2. The gpg --verify command doesn't really verify that I personally created
   the tar file because it only compares the signature with the public key. If
   someone wanted to, they could sign a document as if they were me, and as
   long as their public key is being used to verify it, the verify command
   will act as if nothing was wrong, even though it is not actually my file.
